<h3>Title of Research Study: The Pragmatics of Intonation in Context</h3>
<h3>Principal Investigator: Dr. Jennifer Cole, Department of Linguistics</h3>
<h3>Student Investigator: Thomas Sostarics</h3>
<h3>Supported By Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.</h3>
<h3>IRB STU00213825 </h3>
<h3>Key Information about this research study:</h3>
<h4>The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether to be a part of this study. Information that is more detailed is listed later on in this form.</h4>
<p>The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how people perceive speech in English.</p>
<p>You will be asked to do tasks involving English sentences, such as listening to sentences from an audio recording. We expect that you will be in this research study for no longer than 40 minutes. The risks associated with participation in this study are no greater than those encountered in daily life. There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study, but this study may benefit society if the results lead to a better understanding of how people perceive speech.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?</h3>
<p>We are asking you to take part in this research study because you are 18 to 65 years old.</p>
<p><strong>How many people will be in this study?</strong></p>
<p>We expect about 80 people will be in this research study.</p>
<h3>What should I know about participating in a research study?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Whether or not you take part is up to you.</li>
<li>You can choose not to take part.</li>
<li>You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</li>
<li>Your decision will not be held against you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What happens if I say, &ldquo;Yes, I want to be in this research&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>The research study involves a single session which will last no longer than 40 minutes. After filling out a questionnaire about your language and geographical background, you will be asked to do one or two tasks involving reading, listening to and comprehending sentences. The written sentences will be presented to you on a computer screen and the corresponding audio will be presented through headphones. You will indicate your response to questions about the sentences through keyboard input or by clicking on the response presented on the computer screen. You may be asked to identify the acceptability of a sentence, or whether the way the sentence is said sounds like the most likely way it could be said. You may also be asked to rate the speaker of the sentence on a variety of social characteristics. Your responses will be aggregated with responses from other participants and analyzed for each sentence.</p>
